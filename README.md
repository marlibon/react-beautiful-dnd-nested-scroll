## Nested Scroll Containers — Fixed

The original `react-beautiful-dnd` supported only a single level of scroll containers. As described in [issue #131](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd/issues/131):

> Adding support for n-level deep scroll containers. Currently, only a single level is supported.

**Problem:** When a `<Droppable />` was inside a scroll container (e.g. a column with `overflow: auto`), you could not drop items into the bottom of the list after scrolling — the drop zone did not expand correctly, and the library would emit: _Nested scroll containers are currently not supported_.

**This fork fixes that.** You can now:

- Use Droppables inside scroll containers of any nesting depth
- Scroll a column while dragging and drop at the bottom
- Have parent scroll containers without the previous limitations

### Migration from react-beautiful-dnd

Replace the package in your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-beautiful-dnd": "npm:react-beautiful-dnd-nested-scroll@13.1.3"
  }
}
```

Or install directly:

```bash
npm install react-beautiful-dnd-nested-scroll
# or
yarn add react-beautiful-dnd-nested-scroll
```

Then use `react-beautiful-dnd-nested-scroll` wherever you previously imported `react-beautiful-dnd`, or add a resolver/alias so existing imports keep working.

## About the Original Project

The [original react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) is [archived](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/archiving-repositories) and [deprecated on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-beautiful-dnd). This fork maintains the nested scroll fix for teams that continue to use it. For new projects, consider [Pragmatic drag and drop](https://github.com/atlassian/pragmatic-drag-and-drop).

## Core characteristics

- Beautiful and [natural movement](/docs/about/animations.md) of items 💐
- [Accessible](/docs/about/accessibility.md): powerful keyboard and screen reader support ♿️
- [Extremely performant](/docs/support/media.md) 🚀
- Clean and powerful api which is simple to get started with
- Plays extremely well with standard browser interactions
- [Unopinionated styling](/docs/guides/preset-styles.md)
- No creation of additional wrapper dom nodes - flexbox and focus management friendly!

## Get started 👩‍🏫

We have created [a free course on `egghead.io` 🥚](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd) to help you get started with `react-beautiful-dnd` as quickly as possible.

[![course-logo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2182637/43372837-8c72d3f8-93e8-11e8-9d92-a82adde7718f.png)](https://egghead.io/courses/beautiful-and-accessible-drag-and-drop-with-react-beautiful-dnd)

## Currently supported feature set ✅

- Vertical lists ↕
- Horizontal lists ↔
- Movement between lists (▤ ↔ ▤)
- [Virtual list support 👾](/docs/patterns/virtual-lists.md) - unlocking 10,000 items @ 60fps
- [Combining items](/docs/guides/combining.md)
- Mouse 🐭, keyboard 🎹♿️ and touch 👉📱 (mobile, tablet and so on) support
- [Multi drag support](/docs/patterns/multi-drag.md)
- Incredible screen reader support ♿️ - we provide an amazing experience for english screen readers out of the box 📦. We also provide complete customisation control and internationalisation support for those who need it 💖
- [Conditional dragging](/docs/api/draggable.md#optional-props) and [conditional dropping](/docs/api/droppable.md#conditionally-dropping)
- Multiple independent lists on the one page
- Flexible item sizes - the draggable items can have different heights (vertical lists) or widths (horizontal lists)
- [Add and remove items during a drag](/docs/guides/changes-while-dragging.md)
- Compatible with semantic `<table>` reordering - [table pattern](/docs/patterns/tables.md)
- [Auto scrolling](/docs/guides/auto-scrolling.md) - automatically scroll containers and the window as required during a drag (even with keyboard 🔥)
- Custom drag handles - you can drag a whole item by just a part of it
- Able to move the dragging item to another element while dragging (clone, portal) - [Reparenting your `<Draggable />`](/docs/guides/reparenting.md)
- [Create scripted drag and drop experiences 🎮](/docs/sensors/sensor-api.md)
- Allows extensions to support for [any input type you like 🕹](/docs/sensors/sensor-api.md)
- 🌲 Tree support through the [`@atlaskit/tree`](https://atlaskit.atlassian.com/packages/confluence/tree) package
- **Nested scroll containers** — a Droppable can be inside one or more scroll containers; drop zones update correctly when scrolling
- A `<Droppable />` list can be a scroll container (without a scrollable parent) or be the child of a scroll container (that also does not have a scrollable parent)
- Independent nested lists - a list can be a child of another list, but you cannot drag items from the parent list into a child list
- Server side rendering (SSR) compatible - see [resetServerContext()](/docs/api/reset-server-context.md)
- Plays well with [nested interactive elements](/docs/api/draggable.md#interactive-child-elements-within-a-draggable-) by default

## Motivation 🤔

`react-beautiful-dnd` exists to create beautiful drag and drop for lists that anyone can use - even people who cannot see. For a good overview of the history and motivations of the project you can take a look at these external resources:

- 📖 [Rethinking drag and drop](https://medium.com/@alexandereardon/rethinking-drag-and-drop-d9f5770b4e6b)
- 🎧 [React podcast: fast, accessible and beautiful drag and drop](https://reactpodcast.simplecast.fm/17)

## Not for everyone ✌️

There are a lot of libraries out there that allow for drag and drop interactions within React. Most notable of these is the amazing [`react-dnd`](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd). It does an incredible job at providing a great set of drag and drop primitives which work especially well with the [wildly inconsistent](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html) html5 drag and drop feature. `react-beautiful-dnd` is a higher level abstraction specifically built for lists (vertical, horizontal, movement between lists, nested lists and so on). Within that subset of functionality `react-beautiful-dnd` offers a powerful, natural and beautiful drag and drop experience. However, it does not provide the breadth of functionality offered by `react-dnd`. So `react-beautiful-dnd` might not be for you depending on what your use case is.
